This is a fork beautiful SPT-Realism-Mod (https://github.com/space-commits/SPT-Realism-Mod-Server) for individual custom changes

Main changes:

1) Full custom medicine (the main features are that I do not work on changing the whole system of treatment, but on the consequences of each application)

2) Some changes in loadouts bots (but realy small, because original loadout on Realism Mod so fucking good)

3) Removed some configs parameters

4) Removed some usless (for me) codeblocks and functions

5) Some changes in other code (mostly cleaning and visual changes)
